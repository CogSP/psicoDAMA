    <h1>How to Play Checkers</h1>
</div>

<p>The game of checkers is a beatiful game because we don't know what to say
</p>


</div>   


<p>Checkers and chess are among the world's most beloved board games, andcan be played using the same board. The 8x8 board consisting of 
    64 alternating dark and light squares is a staple in many homes, parks and even bars. According to a 2020 survey, 77% of adults in the U.S. 
    think checkers is a game of skill rather than luck. So do you need to be a master of strategy to win a checkers game? Most would say "yes". 
    Here are some tips on how to play and win.
</p>

<h2>How to play checkers</h2>

<p>Checkers is a two-person game. You'll need a standard checkerboard with 12 checkers per player to start. </p>

<h2>How to set up your board</h2>

<p>Choose who will go first. If this isn't your first match, typically the person who won the last game is the one to go first. A chessboard comes with  
    two different colors of checkers â€” often a combination of red, black or white. The player who goes first will take the dark-colored checkers (red in
     this illustration), and the other player will take the remaining color (white).  Players sit on opposite ends of the board. The board is made of 
     alternating light and dark squares. Place your checkers in the dark spaces so there is an empty light square in the right corner for each player. 
     There should be three rows of four checkers each, placed only in dark squares. </p>
